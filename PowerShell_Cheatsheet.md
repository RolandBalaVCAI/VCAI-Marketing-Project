## üí° PowerShell vs Command Prompt

PowerShell accepts most CMD commands:
- `dir` ‚Üí works in both
- `cd` ‚Üí works in both
- `mkdir` ‚Üí works in both
- `del` ‚Üí works in both

But PowerShell is more powerful:
- Object-oriented output
- Better scripting capabilities
- More consistent command structure
- Pipeline operations with `|`

## üéØ Quick Reference

| Task | PowerShell Command |
|------|-------------------|
| Where am I? | `pwd` |
| List files | `ls` or `dir` |
| Change folder | `cd FolderName` |
| Go back | `cd ..` |
| Make folder | `mkdir NewFolder` |
| Copy file | `cp source.txt dest.txt` |
| Move file | `mv file.txt C:\NewLocation\` |
| Delete file | `rm file.txt` |
| View file | `cat file.txt` |
| Edit file | `notepad file.txt` |
| Find files | `ls -r *.txt` |
| Clear screen | `cls` |

## üìå Pro Tips

1. **Use Tab**: Press Tab to autocomplete paths and commands
2. **Use Quotes**: For paths with spaces: `cd "Program Files"`
3. **Use Wildcards**: `*` matches anything: `rm *.tmp`
4. **Check First**: Use `ls` before `rm` to see what you'll delete
5. **Get Help**: Use `Get-Help command` for any command

Remember: PowerShell is case-insensitive, so `LS`, `ls`, and `Ls` all work the same!
